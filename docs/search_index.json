Our quantitative model is based on expert clinical input and state-of-the-art latent variable measurement model data analysis. We bring multiple domains of symptoms into a single framework for quantifying severity, and identified sub-groups of patients with qualitatively and quantitatively distinct symptom profiles with high accuracy. These patient sub-types experience qualitatively different patterns of progression over time. 2.2 Description of Methods Used Our methodology uses a latent variable measurement model to describe the severity of PD symptoms. We extend this model to identify sub-types of PD using a categorical latent variable modeling approach (factor mixture models). We provide preliminary validity data in the form of model fit statistics and prediction of longitudinal trends. The method and results are described in greater detail in the Methodologic Details and Results section. 2.3 Impact of Results The motivation behind our approach is that PD patients experience the disease with a myriad of signs and symptoms, and that progression of the disease may be difficult to perceive clinically because different symptom domains progress and might have variable impact on quality of life and functional ability. Our approach uses a set of symptoms that are clinically relevant, builds upon prior measurement research, and arrives at a quantifiable metric that can be used to unambiguously track disease course and characterize possible clinical subtypes. The uses of the measurement approach could include outcomes assessment in clinical trials, treatment planning, and building the clinical epidemiologic knowledge base for PD. "],
["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods", " Chapter 3 Methods We use a latent variable measurement model to identify indicators of PD severity. Latent variable measurement models are generalizations of the method of factor analysis developed to quantify psychological constructs. Factor analysis methods are widely used in the fields of psychology, sociology, and medicine. Factor analysis models assume – and attempt to develop a statistical model to quantify – a continuous latent variable (e.g., Parkinson’s Disease severity) is responsible for the covariation observed among various signs and symptoms. We have used these methods to quantify severity in Alzheimer’s disease (Gross et al, 2016). The generalization we use is implemented with Mplus software (Muthén &amp; Muthén, Los Angeles, CA). We use categorical latent variable modeling technique known as factor mixture models to detect subtypes of PD. Factor mixture models are generalizations of classification methods known as K-means clustering, latent class analysis, and factor analysis, and are appropriate when the source of heterogeneity (i.e., membership PD sub-type groups) is unknown and the indicators of subtype group membership are a mix of continuous and categorical variables (Lubke, &amp; Muthén, 2005).

Analysis details and summary of results.", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Latent variable measurement model: Analysis details and summary of results. Choice of indicators for the latent variable measurement model was informed by clinical judgement and prior empirical research using the PPMI database (Hirschauer et al, 2015; Dinov et al 2016). We specifically included only factors that could be available clinically (symptom rating scales, cognitive tests) and excluded high-cost and specialty laboratory-based imaging modalities. We also limit to symptoms measured longitudinally in the PPMI. This reflects our goal that the derived latent variable measurement model be feasible for use clinically and repeatedly to characterize status and course in PD. Broadly speaking, the domains include symptoms assessed in the MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale) parts II &amp; III, cognitive function as assessed with the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), autonomic function as assessed with the SCOPA-AUT (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson’s disease – Autonomic). We omit part I of the MDS-UPDRS following the work of Dinov et al (2016). Inclusion of the domains and measures below is supported by prior work by Hirschauer, Adeli, and Buford (2015) and Dinov et al (2016). The domains were divided into subdomains, which consisted of the sum of the related items. ## ## Running model: foo100.cfa.inp ## System command: C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c cd &quot;S:\\PPMI\\POSTED\\ANALYSIS\\ppmi-submission&quot; &amp;&amp; &quot;Mplus&quot; &quot;foo100.cfa.inp&quot; ## Reading model: foo100.cfa.out Our final confirmatory factor analysis model, parameterized as a bifactor measurement model indicates a reasonably well fitting model. The Confirmatory Fit Index (CFI) is 0.91 and the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) is 0.064. Thresholds for well-fitting models can include CFI of greater than 0.90 (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1998) and RMSEA values of less than 0.06. We accept our results as falling reasonably close to these guidelines and infer we have achieved reasonably good fit. The bifactor measurement models assume a single general trait underlies the signs and symptoms, and several additional factors are present and specific to at least two other indicators. The specific factors are thought to capture symptom-specific covariance that is uncorrelated with the general trait. Our test of the construct validity for the resulting general PPMI-PD Severity Score as an indicator of PD severity is that among PD patients, as they age, the PPMI-PD Severity Score increases for most (but not all). A graphical illustration of each PD patient’s trend (and an overall trend in the blue line) is illustrated in Figure 1. ## Reading model: foo100.cfa.out 4.2 Factor Mixture Models. Analysis details and summary of results. Given an acceptably fitting latent variable measurement model for PD severity, we then identify subgroups of patients with distinct symptom profiles. This is a categorical latent variable generalization of the continuous latent variable model. Our model includes the continuous general and sign-and-symptom-specific factors for the whole PD patient sample bifactor model described in section 1a, but we now include the possibility that our sample of patients is described by two or more population sub-groups with distinct measurement model parameters. This mode of analysis is referred to as factor mixture modeling. Results are shown in Figure 2. This figure shows “estimated difficulty” on the y-axis, which is an indication of the relative importance of the symptom to the general trait (and is technically the level on the latent trait where the mean level of the symptom intensity will be observed). One of the four types has a qualitatively distinct pattern of symptoms. Class 1 is characterized by good cognitive functioning (MCATOT) and low impact of symptoms in daily living (UPDRS part II scores include the NP2F1-NP2F3 indicators), relatively low levels of motor symptoms other than NP3F2 (rest tremor) and NP3F6 (postural/kinetic tremors) and low levels of autonomic involvement (SCAUF1-SCAIF4 refer to symptom domains from the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson’s disease: Autonomic scale). Classes 2-4 differ from each other primarily quantitatively, meaning, the patterns of relative importance of each sign and symptom domain are consistent across class, but the classes differ from one another primarily in the level of the symptom burden expressed at the mean level of the general trait in the class. This quantitative distinction is certainly true for classes 2 &amp; 3, but class 4 has some distinct characteristics relative to classes 2 &amp; 3: Class 4 has a pronounced SCAUF3 (cardiovascular) and SCAUF4 (thermoregulatory) presentation. Class 4 also has relatively low importance for NP3F1 (midline function) and NP3F7 (lower limb bradykinesia). ## ## Running model: goo003.fmm.inp ## System command: C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c cd &quot;S:\\PPMI\\POSTED\\ANALYSIS\\ppmi-submission&quot; &amp;&amp; &quot;Mplus&quot; &quot;goo003.fmm.inp&quot; ## Reading model: goo003.fmm.out ## Reading model: goo003.fmm.out The hope is that this latent classification of PD subtypes has a role in prognostication or management. As preliminary evidence for this, we provide longitudinal trajectories for each group’s general symptom domain progression over time. This is illustrated in Figure 3. This figure also summarizes a view of the relative frequency with which we might expect to observe patients with PD falling in one of the four classes if the patient sample was generated in a fashion similar to that of the PPMI data set. Some inferences regarding the class results are summarized as follows: Class 4 is Rarely observed. Only 26 observations observed over 3 unique patients fit this profile. This is too infrequent to warrant serious inference, but interesting enough to follow-up with a larger sample. Class 1 is observed in about 10% of the observations. The longitudinal trajectory is negative, implying no reliable increase in symptom intensity or frequency over the 4-5 year follow-up. This class had a fundamentally distinct symptom profile and might represent a distinct clinical entity or even false-positive for PD. Class 3 is the most frequently observed latent class, occurring in about 69% of observations. A trend similar to the general trend seen in Figure 1, slowly increasing severity over time. Class 2 is the second-most frequently observed latent class, occurring in about 19% of observations. This class is distinct for having more rapid progression of signs and symptoms relative to class 3. "],
["statistical-analysis.html", "Chapter 5 Statistical analysis", " Chapter 5 Statistical analysis Our factor mixture model fits extremely well, with an entropy value of 0.87. Generally, entropy values of at least 0.7 are desired. Entropy captures the quality of classification of people into different classes, and ranges from 0-1. Greater entropy suggests low overlap in the latent classes, and values greater than 0.8 suggest that correct classification can be expected with at about 90% certainty (Sawatzky et al, 2012). "],
["impact-of-the-analysis.html", "Chapter 6 Impact of the analysis", " Chapter 6 Impact of the analysis Using only clinical markers (UPDRS II &amp; III, MoCA, and SCOPA-AUT) from the PPMI database, we demonstrated reliable subcategorization of PD patients into subclasses based on disease severity. We demonstrated a continuous latent variable is responsible for the covariation observed among various signs and symptoms and use this to subcategorize patients into subgroups with distinct symptom profiles. We presented the relative importance of the symptom to the general trait and defined 4 classes, or symptom patterns. We demonstrated major differences in classes 1 and 4 in autonomic dysfunction; the former having low levels of autonomic involvement and the latter with pronounced symptoms in this domain. Classes 2 and 3 represented varying degrees of symptom burden but were qualitatively similar. Our model also suggests that in a patient sample similar to the PPMI database, the most common latent class would be class 3 (69%, slowly progressing over time) followed class 2 (19%, more rapidly progressing). This is similar to the pattern of progression seen in clinical experience. Given that our analyses were based on a limited sample of 200 PD patients followed for 5 years longitudinally in the PPMI database, validation of these models in larger longitudinal cohorts is needed.
